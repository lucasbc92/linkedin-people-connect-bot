## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (automatically managed by selenium)
- Active LinkedIn account

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedin-people-connection-bot.git
cd linkedin-people-connection-bot
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Using Existing Browser Session (Recommended)

1. **Open Chrome with debugging enabled**:
```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="$(mktemp -d)"

# On Windows:
chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="%TEMP%\chrome_debug"
```

2. **Navigate to LinkedIn** in the opened browser and log in

3. **Perform your search** (e.g., search for "tech recruiter", "software engineer", or any other professionals you want to connect with)

4. **Run the automation**:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Method 2: Fresh Browser Session

Simply run the script without the debugging setup:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will open a new Chrome window where you'll need to manually log in and navigate to your search results.

## Command Line Options

- `-y`, `--yes`: Automatically continue past "close to limit" warnings (will still stop at hard limit)
- `-m`, `--message`: Path to message template file (default: message.txt)
- `-r`, `--reverse`: Navigate in reverse (use Previous button instead of Next)
- `-n`, `--no-message`: Send invitations without a note (faster processing)

Examples:
```bash
python main.py -y
python main.py -m custom_message.txt
python main.py -r  # Navigate in reverse (from newest to oldest search results)
python main.py -n  # Send connection requests without a note
python main.py -y -m my_template.txt -r
python main.py -y -n -r  # Auto-continue, no notes, reverse navigation
```

## Message Customization

The message template is loaded from `message.txt` and can be customized by editing this file:

```
Ol√°, {name}!
Sou Full Stack Developer focado em backend com 5+ anos de experi√™ncia, sendo os √∫ltimos 3 anos em Java Spring & React. Apaixonado por caf√©, simplificar problemas complexos e entregar solu√ß√µes robustas.
Espero que meu perfil desperte seu interesse!
```

### Template Features:
- **Name Personalization**: Use `{name}` anywhere in the message to insert the recipient's first name
- **Character Limit**: Messages are automatically truncated to 300 characters (LinkedIn's limit)
- **Fallback**: If name extraction fails, `{name}` is replaced with an empty string

### Examples:
- `"Hello {name}!"` ‚Üí `"Hello John!"`
- `"Hi {name}, hope you're doing well!"` ‚Üí `"Hi Sarah, hope you're doing well!"`
- If name not found: `"Hello {name}!"` ‚Üí `"Hello !"`

## Safety Features

### Invitation Limit Protection
- **Soft Warning**: When close to weekly limit, asks for user confirmation (unless `-y` flag is used)
- **Hard Limit**: Automatically stops when weekly invitation limit is reached
- **Verification**: Confirms each invitation was sent successfully before proceeding

### Human-like Behavior
- Random delays between actions (1-5 seconds)
- Scrolling to elements before clicking
- JavaScript-based clicking to avoid detection

## How It Works

1. **Page Processing**: Scans the current page for "Connect" buttons
2. **Name Extraction**: Attempts to extract the recipient's name from their profile
3. **Connection Request**:
   - With notes: Clicks "Connect" ‚Üí "Add a note" ‚Üí fills personalized message ‚Üí sends
   - Without notes: Clicks "Connect" ‚Üí "Send without a note" (when `-n` flag is used)
4. **Following**: Clicks any "Follow" buttons on the page
5. **Navigation**: Moves to the next page (or previous page with `-r` flag) of results
6. **Repeat**: Continues until all pages are processed or limits are reached

## Best Practices

1. **Use Conservative Limits**: Don't exceed LinkedIn's weekly invitation limits
2. **Personalize Messages**: Customize the message template for your specific use case
3. **Target Specifically**: Use LinkedIn's search filters to target relevant profiles
4. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of your weekly invitation count
5. **Respect LinkedIn's Terms**: Use this tool responsibly and in accordance with LinkedIn's terms of service

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromeDriver Issues**:
   - Ensure Chrome browser is installed
   - The script uses selenium's built-in ChromeDriver management

2. **Connection Failures**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify you're logged into LinkedIn
   - Ensure the search results page is loaded

3. **Element Not Found**:
   - LinkedIn's UI may have changed
   - Try refreshing the page and running again

### Debug Mode

Add print statements or modify the logging to see what's happening:
```python
print(f"Processing button {i+1}: {button.text}")
```

## Limitations

- LinkedIn limits invitations to ~100 per week for free accounts
- The script works with LinkedIn's current UI (subject to change)
- May not work with all LinkedIn page layouts
- Designed for desktop LinkedIn interface
